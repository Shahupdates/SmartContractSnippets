### Ethereum

The Ethereum folder contains Solidity contract snippets:

- `ERC20.sol`: A basic ERC20 token contract implementation.
- `ERC721.sol`: A basic ERC721 (NFT) token contract implementation.
- `Ownable.sol`: A contract that provides basic authorization control functions.
- `SafeMath.sol`: A library for safe mathematical operations.

### BinanceSmartChain

The Binance Smart Chain (BSC) folder contains Solidity contract snippets, similar to Ethereum:

- `BEP20.sol`: A basic BEP20 token contract implementation.
- `BEP721.sol`: A basic BEP721 (NFT) token contract implementation.
- `Ownable.sol`: A contract that provides basic authorization control functions.
- `SafeMath.sol`: A library for safe mathematical operations.

### Solana

The Solana folder contains Rust contract snippets:

- `helloworld`: A simple Hello World contract.
- `Cargo.toml`: The package configuration file for the Hello World contract.

### Polkadot

The Polkadot folder contains Ink! contract snippets:

- `flipper`: A simple contract that holds a boolean value which can be flipped and retrieved.
- `Cargo.toml`: The package configuration file for the Flipper contract.

## Usage

To use these snippets, copy the file into your project directory and include them in your project as necessary. Remember to replace any placeholder values with your own.
