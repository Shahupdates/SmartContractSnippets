### Ethereum

The Ethereum directory contains Solidity contract snippets that can be used as building blocks for developing more complex contracts on the Ethereum network:

- `ERC20.sol`: This file provides a basic implementation of an ERC20 token contract, following the ERC20 standard. It includes functions for transferring tokens, checking balances, and allowing other contracts to spend tokens on the owner's behalf.
  
- `ERC721.sol`: This file provides a basic implementation of an ERC721 token contract, following the ERC721 standard, also known as "Non-Fungible Tokens" (NFTs). It includes functions for transferring tokens, checking token ownership, and allowing other contracts to spend tokens on the owner's behalf.
  
- `Ownable.sol`: This file provides a basic contract that has an owner address, and provides authorization control functions. This simplifies the implementation of "user permissions".
  
- `SafeMath.sol`: This file provides a library that helps avoid integer overflow and underflow errors. It provides safe versions of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.

### BinanceSmartChain

The Binance Smart Chain directory contains Solidity contract snippets, similar to Ethereum, which are compliant with the Binance Smart Chain (BSC):

- `BEP20.sol`: This file provides a basic implementation of a BEP20 token contract, following the BEP20 standard (analogous to ERC20). It includes functions for transferring tokens, checking balances, and allowing other contracts to spend tokens on the owner's behalf.
  
- `BEP721.sol`: This file provides a basic implementation of a BEP721 token contract, following the BEP721 standard (analogous to ERC721). It includes functions for transferring tokens, checking token ownership, and allowing other contracts to spend tokens on the owner's behalf.
  
- `Ownable.sol`: This file is similar to the Ethereum `Ownable.sol` and provides a basic contract that has an owner address, and provides authorization control functions.
  
- `SafeMath.sol`: This file is similar to the Ethereum `SafeMath.sol` and provides a library that helps avoid integer overflow and underflow errors.

### Solana

The Solana directory contains Rust contract snippets compatible with the Solana network:

- `helloworld/src/lib.rs`: This file provides a simple "Hello World!" smart contract in Rust. It demonstrates the basic structure of a Solana program, including a function to process instructions.
  
- `helloworld/Cargo.toml`: This file is the package configuration file for the Hello World contract. It includes the necessary dependencies for the smart contract.

### Polkadot

The Polkadot directory contains Ink! contract snippets compatible with the Polkadot network:

- `flipper/lib.rs`: This file provides a simple Ink! contract called "Flipper", which has a boolean value that can be flipped and retrieved. It demonstrates how to define a contract, a storage item, messages, and a constructor in Ink!.
  
- `flipper/Cargo.toml`: This file is the package configuration file for the Flipper contract. It includes the necessary dependencies for the smart contract.

## Usage

To use these snippets, copy the file into your project directory and include them in your project as necessary. Remember to replace any placeholder values with your own. Refer to the individual README files in each directory for more detailed usage instructions.
