# SmartContractSnippets
Open-source repository containing smart contract snippets to make developing smart contracts easier.
The repository could be expanded over time to include snippets for other blockchains like Polkadot, Cardano, etc., or even include more complex contract examples like decentralized exchanges (DEX) or yield farming contracts.
In the future, it might be a good idea to provide tests and documentations for each snippet to ensure that they work as expected and to guide users on how to use them properly.
